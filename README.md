# Liminal

A browser-based Laravel IDE. PHP 8.4 runs entirely in WebAssembly — no server, no installs, no uploads. Write, run, and preview Laravel applications without leaving the tab.

**[liminal.aschmelyun.com](https://liminal.aschmelyun.com)** — deployed as a static site on Cloudflare Pages. Feel free to try it out; everything you type and build is sandboxed entirely to your browser and never leaves your machine.

## Features

| View | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Preview** | Navigate routes and see rendered HTML output. Tailwind CSS v4 is injected automatically. |
| **Code** | Browse and edit project files with syntax highlighting (PHP, Blade, JS/TS, JSON, CSS). |
| **Terminal** | Run Artisan commands directly in the browser with command history. |
| **Agent** | OpenAI-powered assistant that reads/writes files and runs Artisan to build features. |
| **Tools** | Import from GitHub, export as `.zip`, sync to a local folder, and configure settings. |

Additional features:
- **Share URLs** — encode your file diffs into a URL; anyone who opens it gets your changes applied automatically
- **Dark mode** — light, dark, or system theme, persisted across sessions
- **Local sync** — mirror the virtual filesystem to a local folder via the File System Access API (Chrome/Edge)

## Tech Stack

- [Vue 3](https://vuejs.org) + TypeScript + Vite
- [Tailwind CSS v4](https://tailwindcss.com)
- [CodeMirror 6](https://codemirror.net)
- [Laravel 13](https://laravel.com) — embedded Laravel app bundled into `app.zip`
- [@php-wasm/web-8-4](https://github.com/WordPress/wordpress-playground) — PHP 8.4 compiled to WebAssembly

## Running Locally

```bash
npm install
```

Before building, make sure Composer dependencies are installed inside the embedded Laravel app:

```bash
cd ../liminal/app   # path to the Laravel project
composer install --no-dev --optimize-autoloader
```

> [!NOTE]
> I gotta figure out a way to do this without Composer and without having to commit the whole dang vendor directory.

Then build and preview:

```bash
npm run build
npm run preview
```

`npm run build` bundles the Laravel app into `public/app.zip`, runs type checking, and produces the final static assets. `npm run preview` starts a local web server serving that output — use this rather than `npm run dev` when you need to test the full built artifact (e.g. WASM chunk reassembly).

### Build pipeline

The build runs three steps:

1. **`bundle-app.js`** — zips the Laravel project from `../liminal/app` into `public/app.zip`
2. **`vue-tsc`** — TypeScript type checking
3. **`split-wasm.js`** — chunks WASM files >24 MB into `.wasm.part*` files with a manifest, required for Cloudflare Pages' file size limit

## How It Works

On boot, the app downloads `app.zip` and extracts it into an in-memory virtual filesystem. From that point on, all PHP execution — routing, database queries, Artisan commands — happens entirely client-side via the WASM runtime. There is no backend; the production deployment on Cloudflare Pages is purely static files.

[`SharedArrayBuffer`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/SharedArrayBuffer) is required by the WASM runtime and needs `Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy: same-origin` and `Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy: credentialless` headers, which are configured in both the Vite dev server and `public/_headers` for Cloudflare Pages.

## Limitations

- No network access from PHP (no `file_get_contents` over HTTP, no `curl`, no Composer)
- The `vendor/` directory is pre-bundled in `app.zip` and cannot be modified
- SQLite only — no MySQL/Postgres
- Performance is slower than native PHP, especially on first boot
